# Problems that need to be analyzed because they offer valuable information

* 1389: array_splice let's you put elements in an array without removing the existing element at that location (the keys for every element after it are incremented by 1)
* 1390: slight variation of the divisors algorithm shown on codility - do memorize
* 169: variation of leader election (leader always exists) - do memorize
* 1396: you use `number_format($nr, $precision)` to set the precision of a float number - yes, it's accurate
* 1396: the problem can only be solved using `Iterator` objects

# Problems that proved to be more than I can handle at the moment of taking

* 5349
* 1390
* 74
* 198 (I didn't submit anything because I didn't research DP well enough)
* 1396* (unsolved)

# To do

* Check every single problem that didn't get a faster that 100% score in order to learn how to optimize the algorithms
